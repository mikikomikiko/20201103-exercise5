#1 For the data InsectSpray, make a table for the number of insects for each spray with the mean, median and standard error.

```{r}
InsectSprays #open datasets
str(InsectSprays)
table(InsectSprays)

 knitr::kable(InsectSprays)
```






#2Print a plot to see the differences of counts between sprays. Include a caption explaining the figure. Which type of plot is the one you choose and why?

#3Test for differences between sprays using anova and a posthoc comparison and redo the previous plot including the representation of all posthoc differences.

#4Test for differences between sprays using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. Again, redo the plot with these results.

#5Transform count data using sqrt(counts) and redo the anova, the Tukey posthoc comparison and the plot.

#6Test for normality of residuals for the two performed anova analyses of points 4 and 6 using shapiro.test() and use plot the anova to see the qqplots and compare them.

#7Which of the previous analysis is the adequate in this case? Why? Is there any difference in the results between the square root transformed ANOVA and the Kruskal-Wallis analyses? Is there any difference in the results between the direct ANOVA and the square root transformed ANOVA? Which ones?


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
